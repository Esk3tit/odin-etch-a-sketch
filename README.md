# Etch A Sketch Project

## Introduction

This project is part of The Odin Project curriculum. It's an implementation of the classic Etch A Sketch game, enhanced with additional features and functionalities that demonstrate my understanding of CSS resets, DOM manipulation with JavaScript, and computational color handling.

## Features

- **Standard Etch A Sketch Functionality**: Basic drawing capabilities using cursor movements.
- **Extra Credit Implementations**:
  - **Dynamic Grid Size**: Users can adjust the size of the sketch grid using the 'New Grid' button, which allows for choosing both the length and width of the grid.
  - **Color Selection**: Users can choose different colors for drawing, including a progressive darken feature and a rainbow color option.
- **CSS Reset**: Implemented a CSS reset to ensure consistency across different browsers.
- **DOM Manipulation**: Used JavaScript to dynamically alter the webpage's content and style.
- **Computational Color Handling**: Integrated functionality to work with colors computationally, allowing for a more versatile drawing experience.

## How to Use

1. **Start Drawing**: Simply hover your mouse over the grid to start sketching.
2. **New Grid Button**: Change the grid size by specifying the desired length and width.
3. **Color Modes**:
   - **Darken**: Darkens a random color or a white grid cell to black within 10 mouseovers.
   - **Rainbow**: Changes grid cells to a random color.
   - **Black**: Colors the grid cell black.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS (with a focus on CSS resets)
- JavaScript (emphasis on DOM manipulation and computational color theory)

## Lessons Learned

Through this project, I deepened my understanding of:
- The importance of CSS resets in standardizing the look of web pages across different browsers.
- Manipulating the DOM using JavaScript to dynamically change the content and appearance of a webpage.
- Working with colors in a computational aspect, enhancing user interaction and visual appeal.
